## Get started

### GitHub Template

This is a template repo. Click the green [Use this template](https://github.com/SylvainMarty/phantombuster-vite-typescript-template/generate) button to get started.

### Run locally

Open one terminal and Run the following command to start the development watcher:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open a second terminal and run the following command to start the script:
```bash
pnpm script
```


## Usage

The template contains the following `pnpm` scripts:

* `dev` - Start the file watcher (will recompile the code on source file change)
* `script` - Start the script
* `build` - Build for production
* `deploy` - Deploy on Phantombuster (see the **Deployment** section below)
* `lint` - Checks your code for any linting errors
* `test` - Run all tests
* `test:watch` - Run all tests with watch mode
* `test:coverage` - Run all tests with code coverage report
* `prepare` - Script for setting up husky hooks

## Phantombuster directives

You can change the Phantombuster script directives in the `package.json` under the `phantomBuster` key:
* `image` (required): the Phantombuster image to use (ex: `web-node:v3`)
* `flags` (optional, default `""`): the Phantombuster flags to use (ex: `save-folder`)
* `dependencies` (optional, default `""`): custom Phantombuster dependencies (ex: `lib-Foo.js, lib-OtherModule.js`)

The directives will be appended automatically at the start of the main script uploaded to Phantombuster.

## Deployment

Create a new Github Actions repository secret named `PHANTOM_BUSTER_API_KEY` containing your Phantombuster API key.
Use this documentation to learn [how to create an API key](https://hub.phantombuster.com/docs/api#how-to-find-my-api-key).

The deployment will be done automatically when you or merge your code to the `main` branch.

If you want to deploy from your local environment, you must create a file `phantombuster.cson` at the root of the project.
Follow the [Phantombuster SDK documentation](https://hub.phantombuster.com/docs/sdk#setup) to learn how to create this file.
